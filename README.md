# Computer Vision HW1

This is my First Homework in Computer Vision Course. This Homework consists of four questions as follows:

**Question One:** Harris Corner Detection and Matching <br>
**Question Two:** Perspective <br>
**Question Three:** Homography <br>
**Question Four:** Homography Computation <br>

You can find the description of the homework in HW1.pdf. <br>
Also the report for each question is in a notebook file in **notebooks** folder with the name of the question. <br>
We have two other folders, obviously the **resources** one containing raw images and the **res** one containing responses.
